## ✨ Description

This website is designed to help customers easily book various salon and spa services such as:
- Haircuts  
- Spa treatments  
- Facial care  
- And other beauty services  

The application was developed as a **real collaboration project** with **Angelic Salon & Spa**, a beauty salon located in **Prabumulih, South Sumatra, Indonesia**.  
It was created as part of a **university course project**, where I was required to partner with a real business.  

Through this collaboration, the website aims to help the salon **digitize its booking process, service scheduling, and daily operations**.  
Previously, most activities such as booking records, customer lists, and financial reports were **manually written in a physical logbook**.  
Now, this website allows the salon to:
- Record and manage bookings digitally  
- Track monthly customer statistics  
- Manage financial transactions and revenue summaries  
- Simplify administrative tasks through a web-based dashboard  

The app also includes a **Firebase-based login system** and an **admin dashboard** for managing hairstylists, schedules, and service listings.
